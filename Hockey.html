            That's “Mr. Hockey” to you. Gordie Howe's 801 career goals set a then record in the NHL, and, as a member of the Red Wings “Production Line,” he won four Stanley Cups (1950, 1952, 1954-55). In addition to being a scorer, “Mr. Elbows” was also known for his gritty play. Not that Im condoning fisticuffs, but, unlike some players (cough, Gretzky, cough), Howe didn't need an enforcer to fight his battles. He inspired the “Gordie Howe hat trick,” which was a goal, an assist, and a fight in one game. And Howe played until he was 52, but that's like 100 in hockey years. </p><a target="_blank" class="two" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordie_Howe">Know More</a>

Wayne Gretzky shattered long-standing records, notably scoring an unprecedented 894 goals. He also earned four Stanley Cups with the Edmonton Oilers (1984-85, 1987-88) and was named the NHL's MVP nine times (1980-87, 1989). After being traded to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988, he helped popularize ice hockey in the United States, paving the way for the game's expansion.</p><a target="_blank" class="two" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky">Know More</a>
